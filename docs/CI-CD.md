# CI/CD Pipeline

How I'd set up automated testing and deployment.

## Testing

Every push and pull request should run tests automatically. If tests fail, the merge gets blocked.

I'd run Go tests for the backend, PHPUnit for the analytics service, and at least verify the frontend builds without errors.

## Deployment Flow

### With ECS

Once tests pass on the main branch:
1. Build Docker images for backend and analytics
2. Push them to Amazon ECR
3. Update the ECS task definitions with new image tags
4. ECS handles the rolling update
5. If health checks fail, it automatically rolls back

GitHub Actions can handle all of this. Just need AWS credentials stored as secrets.

### With Kubernetes and ArgoCD

This is simpler because of GitOps:
1. Tests pass
2. Build and push images to ECR
3. Update the image tags in Kubernetes manifests
4. Commit and push the changes
5. ArgoCD detects the change and deploys automatically

Everything is driven by what's in Git. No need to give GitHub Actions access to the cluster.

## Blue-Green Strategy

The goal is zero downtime. Deploy the new version without killing the old one first.

For ECS, configure the service to keep 100% healthy during deployments. It creates new tasks, waits for them to pass health checks, then terminates the old ones. If the new tasks fail health checks, the deployment stops and nothing changes.

Kubernetes works the same way with a RollingUpdate strategy.

## Canary Deployments

1. Deploy the new version with just one replica
2. Route 10% of traffic to it via load balancer weights
3. Monitor error rates and response times in CloudWatch
4. If metrics look good after 10-15 minutes, gradually scale up
5. If anything looks off, scale it down immediately and investigate

I'd script the metric checks in the GitHub Actions workflow so it can auto-rollback if thresholds are exceeded.

## Feature Flags

For more complex cases like gradual rollouts or targeting specific users, something like LaunchDarkly of flagsmitth can be helpful

## Rollback

If a deployment makes it through but breaks production, rollback should be fast.

For ECS: update the service to point at the previous task definition.
For Kubernetes: undo the last rollout.
With ArgoCD: rollback to a previous Git revision or just revert the commit.



## Branch Strategy

- `main` branch: auto-deploys to production after tests pass
- `develop` branch: auto-deploys to staging for integration testing
- Feature branches: run tests only, no deployment

Require pull request approvals before merging to main.

## Secrets

Store these in GitHub repository secrets:
- AWS access credentials
